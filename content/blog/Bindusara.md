Bindusara is the second Mauryan emperor of India. He is son of the great king Chandragupta maurya and father of the king Ashoka. Some sources provided strong evidence about this. But some people claim that he is son of of the king Shushunaga. 

Most of Jain legends wrote about Chandragupta maurya and most of Buddhist legends wrote about Ashoka. There is not much documentation available about Bindusara.

Bindusara consolidated Mauryan empire after death of his father.
