Kent Beck created four rules of software design. The rules are in priority order.

- Passes the tests

    The main aim while developing software is to make it work as expected and tests ensure that whether software is working as expected or not.


- Reveals intention

    This rule says that code should easy to understand and readable. The way to make it readable and understandable is to reveal your intention in code so that readers will understand what your purpose was when writing it.

- No duplication

    Kent says that one way of achieving good design is to eliminate duplication from code.  The DRY and SPOT are principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition. He expressed it as saying everything should be said "Once and only Once."

- Fewest elements

    The last rule tells that anything that doesnâ€™t serve the three prior rules should be removed.
