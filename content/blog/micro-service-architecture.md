#### Introduction

![Architecture](/hugo_site/images/architecture.png)

Microservice architecture is a way of designing an application where the whole application is divided into small services. In this architecture, small services are developed and deployed without any dependency on each other.

Before a microservice architecture application is built as a single unit, it is called a "monolith." It slows down the process of developing and deploying an application. And making changes to the application was not flexible because it affected the entire system.

A modification made to a small section of code might require building and deploying an entirely new version of software. So to scale a specific function of an application also means you have to scale the entire application.


#### Benefits of Microservices

  - Simpler to deploy
  - Simpler to understand
  - Reusable across business
  - Faster defect isolation
  - Minimized risk from change
